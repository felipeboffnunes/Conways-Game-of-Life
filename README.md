# Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by John Conway. The system works alone from its initial state, following the rules of the game. By creating different patterns it is possible to see interesting results. 

# John Horton Conway
John is a mathematician working on subjects as theory of finite groups, knot theory, number theory, combinatorial game theory and coding theory. He spent most of his career at University of Cambridge and Princeton University.
His most praised invention is the Game of Life, although John has already come out saying it was a “mistake” to produce such a “game”, since now people generally recognize him for one of his works which he doesn’t really feel as his “masterwork”. Life really is a bitch.

# Cellular Automaton
Cellular Automatons work basically as a grid of states (such as 0 or 1). Each cell of the grid is in a given state, and the next state of the whole grid is a result of the rules implied by the system. The subject was discovered in the 1940s by Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann (who else could it be).      

# Rules of the Game
First, the environment (or universe) of the game must be a two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells. Every cell interacts with its 8 neighbours. Each cell can be either dead (0) or alive (1).
<ol>
  <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
<li> Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li> Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>
The initial pattern of the system is called the seed.
